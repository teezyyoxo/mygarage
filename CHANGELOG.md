# Changelog

All notable changes to MyGarage will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.1.4] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Service visit category is now a fleet-suggested field like the line-item
  description: pick a built-in default (Maintenance, Inspection, Collision,
  Upgrades, Detailing) or type your own, and any custom value typed on one
  vehicle becomes a suggestion for every vehicle in the fleet. The
  `service_visits.service_category` / `service_line_items.category` columns no
  longer enforce a fixed list at the database level.
- Added a live server log viewer to Settings → System (admin only), backed by
  an in-memory ring buffer of recent backend log lines, with level filtering,
  pause/resume, and clear — useful for diagnosing a silent/zero-result import
  without needing container log access.
- PDF vehicle imports that produce no extractable OCR text now log a clear
  warning (visible in the new live log viewer) and report the note as skipped
  rather than a silent zero-result success.

## [3.1.3] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- The Vehicle Hub / CarChief Command settings card now accepts both the exact
  Command VIN and a Command URL with an explicit port. Test Connection checks
  the pair without saving it; Save becomes available only after values change
  and that unchanged pair passes, then the backend re-tests before persisting.
- Vehicle Import now opens a warning/confirmation modal before the JSON/PDF
  file picker so users see the data impact before selecting a file.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- Full database export/import now supports moving a MyGarage deployment to another server.
- Full-backup imports require a warning, an explicit Merge or Replace choice, and a second confirmation. Merge shows a complete record/table and uploaded-file preview before applying; Replace creates a safety backup before wiping and restoring the imported data.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- Vehicle Import now accepts PDF files. MyGarage stores the original PDF as a vehicle document and uses OCR to save extracted text as a vehicle note.
- JSON remains the format for complete vehicle backup and restore; PDF import is intended for document capture and review.
- The top navigation now displays the running MyGarage version and frontend build commit for easier deployment verification.
- Vehicle Hub transfer controls are disabled outside the configured Command VIN and explain the integration scope on hover.
- Vehicle Hub scope is now configured by VIN in Settings. Test Connection verifies that VIN against the vehicle paired with CarChief Command before enabling transfers.
- The verified Command VIN is now persisted as a locked setting with a Last verified timestamp; changing it requires an explicit Change VIN action and a new successful connection test.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Optional Vehicle Hub integration for reviewed, bidirectional service-history transfers between the single configured MyGarage vehicle and CarChief Command.
- **Send to Command** actions for one service visit or the full service-history list, with a zero-write preview before anything is applied.
- Explicit duplicate decisions for Create, Update Linked, Merge, Replace, Keep Both, Link Without Changes, Ignore Once, and Never Sync; possible matches are never resolved automatically.
- Source identity, update timestamp, and fingerprint metadata for imported service visits through additive migration 085, making repeated transfers idempotent.
- `Imported from Command` provenance labels, read-only treatment for Command-owned mirrors, and exact service-visit deep links from Command back into MyGarage.
- Private, bearer-authenticated, VIN-scoped integration endpoints plus an authenticated MyGarage UI proxy; the shared token is never sent to the browser.

### Changed
- Service visits imported from Command must be edited or deleted in Command and transferred again; ordinary MyGarage-owned service visits retain their existing edit and delete behavior.
- Vehicle Hub transfers are deliberately limited to service-history fields: service date, mileage at service, category/type, description/sub-type, notes, provider/invoice context, and cost.

### Security
- No photos, attachments, documents, fuel/DEF/propane records, reminders, telemetry, trips, locations, DTCs, standalone odometer observations, vehicle profile data, or records for any other VIN are exposed to or synchronized by this integration.
- Delete propagation and continuous automatic synchronization remain disabled. Every actionable transfer requires a fresh, one-use review and explicit decisions before a target write occurs.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- Forms now report validation errors on the field that caused them, instead of a bare `Request failed with status code 422` (#140).
- Numeric fields accept either decimal separator — `528,25` and `528.25` both work. (The window sticker's MSRP fields are not yet covered.)
- Optional numeric fields left blank now save as empty instead of being rejected (#140).
- Invalid text typed into a numeric field — like `abc`, or a comma decimal on a mismatched keyboard — is now reported instead of being silently discarded on save.
- Registering with a weak password now shows the actual reason on the password field, instead of `[object Object],[object Object]`.
- Error messages across the app no longer show raw text like `Request failed with status code 500`; 404s keep the backend's specific reason (e.g. "Recipient user not found") instead of a generic message.
- Service history PDF: repaired text overlap, clipping and column alignment, and the Description column now shows the actual service detail instead of "N/A" on every row; thanks [@SCDT95](https://github.com/SCDT95) (#145).
- Building the Docker image locally no longer takes ~18 minutes on many-core machines; the frontend build stage moved off Alpine to a glibc base.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- Parts & supplies: light inventory for consumables — track purchases, usage, on-hand quantity, and average unit cost per supply; consume supplies inside a service visit (cost folds into the visit total); a per-vehicle "Supplies used" tab and a full history view. Household-shared catalog (#122).
- Torque Pro: ingest OBD2 telemetry and GPS from the Torque Pro Android app via a per-device upload URL, managed alongside WiCAN devices (#117).
- Trips & location: GPS-breadcrumb trips from Torque with a route map, a last-known-location card, and a per-vehicle location-tracking opt-out (#118).
- CSV exports of fuel and odometer records now follow your unit preference — an imperial account gets miles, gallons and price per gallon instead of metric (#128). The file records which units it uses, so re-importing it converts back correctly.
- The interface is now fully translatable — roughly 1,600 strings extracted across analytics, vehicle detail, wizards, modals, settings, notification setup, record forms, validation messages, dropdown options and server-supplied status values.
- German: complete translation of all six namespaces; thanks [@SCDT95](https://github.com/SCDT95) (#125, #126).
- Accent colour: pick from six UI accent colours in Quick Settings, saved to your account.
- ATV is now a selectable vehicle type.
- Engine-hours usage tracking for hour-metered vehicles (ATVs, side-by-sides, equipment) with full parity to distance — an hours history, fuel efficiency as fuel-per-hour and cost-per-hour, hours-based service records and reminders, analytics, the homepage widget, PDF reports and CSV import/export. A vehicle can now track distance and engine hours together (dual tracking).
- French (fr) translation — thanks [@roondar](https://github.com/roondar) (#132).
- Vehicle detail: standard and optional equipment are now editable in a slide-in sidecar (opened from the Equipment buttons next to Edit) — add and remove items, saved to the vehicle — replacing the read-only dropdown cards.
- Vehicle detail: Purchase, Sale and MSRP are combined into one editable Pricing card — edit purchase/sale dates and prices and the MSRP figures from a slide-in sidecar.

### Changed
- Translations: filled 74 keys that were missing from every language (engine-hours tracking, the hours analytics charts, and the vehicle card/sidecar editors) plus the 36 that left the dashboard in English — French is now complete.
- Polish, Russian and Ukrainian: fixed 23 screen titles that read "Title" in the local language (the garage heading showed "Tytuł"/"Заголовок" instead of "My Garage").
- Refreshed the interface onto a consistent design system — shared cards, forms, buttons, chips and tables with a single accent-driven theme.
- The vehicle "Maintenance" stat tile is now labelled "Reminders".
- The Fuel tab shows its sub-tab bar only when there's more than one sub-tab (e.g. DEF), instead of a lone "Fuel" entry that just repeated the tab.
- Redesigned the Address Book: category filter chips (with Gas Station and RV Park) replace the dropdown and the separate Gas Stations button, contact cards open an edit sidecar, and Add/Edit are slide-in panels.
- Redesigned the garage Analytics page: Cost by Category is a donut with a per-category breakdown, Running Costs by Vehicle reads cleaner without a scrollbar, and the spending-trend average lines now span the full range.
- Toggle switches now read as the accent colour when on and red when off, everywhere they appear; the Find POI "Use My Location" button is sized to its label.
- Settings → System Configuration: the Debug, "show both units" and mobile quick-entry checkboxes are now toggle switches.
- Settings → File Management: the Window Sticker enable and OCR checkboxes are now toggle switches, and the two cards use a masonry layout so the Window Sticker card sizes to its content instead of stretching.
- Settings → Integrations: enable checkboxes are now toggle switches, the NHTSA card takes a shield icon, provider Edit links use the accent colour, the CarComplaints and LiveLink "About" details moved into a help sidecar (opened by a question-mark button in each card's corner), and the layout stacks CarComplaints and LiveLink beside NHTSA with Shop Finder full-width.
- LiveLink settings now open in a slide-in sidecar instead of a centred modal, with every checkbox replaced by a toggle switch.
- Settings → Notifications: each provider's enable control and every per-event notification are now toggle switches, and the event groups are always expanded instead of hidden behind an accordion.
- Editing a vehicle now opens a slide-in sidecar from the vehicle page instead of a separate full-page form, and saving returns you straight to the vehicle without a page reload.
- The vehicle "Edit" panel is now "Vehicle Settings" and holds only the settings the info cards don't cover — nickname, type, usage tracking, fuel type, DEF, the window sticker and Torque Pro sources; everything else is edited by clicking the card that shows it.
- The window sticker moved off the vehicle Overview into Vehicle Settings, and uploading one now opens a slide-in sidecar instead of a centred modal.
- Torque Pro sources moved off the vehicle Overview into Vehicle Settings, replacing the "Connected Devices" card.
- Vehicle Details, Powertrain and Warranty cards now appear even when empty, so their fields can be filled in on a vehicle whose VIN didn't decode.
- Migration runner: squash (`REPLACES`) support plus a create_all↔migrations schema-parity diagnostic; reconciled long-standing schema drift (address_book NOT NULL tightening, dropped dead imperial columns, deduplicated indexes).

### Removed
- Maintenance templates: the retired feature and its endpoints are gone — application had been a no-op 410 since the schedule system was removed in 2.31.0.
- Dropped 14 unreachable components, schemas and types (~1790 lines) left behind by earlier refactors, along with the translation keys only they used.
- Settings → System Configuration: removed the light/dark theme selector — the theme toggle in the top bar is now the single control.

### Fixed
- Vehicle Analytics: fuel efficiency alerts are now translated and follow your unit preference. They were English prose with L/100km baked in, shown even on imperial accounts.
- Re-importing a CSV you exported no longer multiplies distances by 1.609 and volumes by 3.785. Every export since the extended fuel columns landed was being read back as if it were imperial (#128).
- Imported fuel records showed the wrong price per gallon on imperial accounts — $2.50/gal displayed as $0.66. Imports now record what the price is measured against, and a migration repairs existing rows (#128).
- Torque Pro and WiCAN setup URLs are now absolute, so they can be pasted into the device. They were emitted as bare paths like `/api/v1/torque/<token>/upload` (#129).
- LiveLink: revoking a Torque source or deleting a WiCAN device no longer fails with a server error once it has reported any data. Its telemetry, sessions and DTCs are kept.
- Vehicle Analytics: spending anomalies now use your configured currency and language. The sentence was composed server-side with a hardcoded "$" and English text, so it ignored both (#131).
- Fuel summary on hours-tracked vehicles no longer shows a distance-based cost-per-mile stat, and the imperial fuel rate now reads GPH.
- OIDC: login failed with "Failed to verify ID token" against providers whose issuer ends in a slash (Rauthy), because the saved issuer URL has it stripped. The `iss` claim is now checked against the discovery document.
- Theme: the `primary` colour token was never defined, so roughly 560 uses of `bg-primary` / `text-primary` / `border-primary` rendered uncoloured.
- Dates, numbers and units now follow the selected language rather than the browser's locale.
- Calendar: the month grid and weekday headers rendered in English for every language.
- Nearby places and shop finder: distances and the search radius ignored the unit preference.
- Analytics, vehicle wizard, window sticker and service line items: a hardcoded `$` is now formatted in the selected currency.
- Vehicle edit: switching language while editing silently discarded everything typed.
- Family management: the multi-user toggle showed the literal text `{t('modal.multiUserMode')} enabled` in its confirmation toast.
- Fuel defaults: saving a default payment method or trip type reported "Unit preference saved!".
- Pushover setup: the API token field lost the "/ App Token" half of its label.
- Notification and file settings: several field labels rendered in English even though their translations already existed.
- Several settings and fuel labels shipped different text than the code appeared to specify, from stale inline fallbacks.
- Toll transactions: the vendor-name lookup shadowed the translation function.
- Settings: switching auth mode away from "none" silently failed to save.
- Settings: changing an unrelated setting (timezone, debug) no longer rewrites the OIDC configuration.
- Reminders: the notification scheduler could crash on a later run once any reminder had been notified, from a naive vs timezone-aware timestamp comparison.
- Deleting a service visit no longer leaves its auto-synced odometer reading behind as an orphaned record.
- Pop-up notifications raised while a slide-in panel is open are now announced by screen readers and can be dismissed.
- Migration 079 left a stray comma that could break SQLite startup with `near ",": syntax error` and stall the migrations behind it (caught in 3.0.0-rc2); thanks [@SCDT95](https://github.com/SCDT95) (#137).
- PostgreSQL: migrations 054/055 no longer create duplicate foreign keys against a `create_all` baseline (supported-dialect correctness fix; SQLite unaffected).

### Security
- Settings: sensitive values (OIDC client secret, notification tokens, SMTP password, POI API keys) are masked as `********` in API responses; saving a masked value keeps the stored secret.
- Bump `cryptography` 48.0.1 → 50.0.0 (GHSA Bleichenbacher oracle in PKCS#7 `EnvelopedData`; unused here, alert cleanup).
- Analytics: sanitize `vin` and exception text in the PDF-export error logs (CodeQL `py/log-injection`).
- Frontend build: drop the `existsSync` check-then-read in the service-worker font injector (CodeQL `js/file-system-race`).

### Build
- Bump backend deps: fastapi 0.138.2 → 0.141.1, granian 2.7.8 → 2.8.1, ruff 0.15.20 → 0.16.1, joserfc, matplotlib, pandas, pandas-stubs, pillow-heif.

## [2.31.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Fuel: optional **Rebate** field (points, discounts, cash back) next to Total Cost; Total Cost then stores the net paid (price × volume − rebate), so all cost surfaces and CSV/JSON export/import reflect it (migration 067).
- Settings: Brazilian timezones in the System timezone dropdown — 12 IANA zones covering Brazil's UTC-2/-3/-4/-5 offsets; thanks [@sigrist](https://github.com/sigrist) (#112).
- OIDC: `MYGARAGE_TRUSTED_HOSTS` allow-lists a self-hosted issuer that resolves to a private/LAN IP (split-horizon DNS), relaxing the SSRF private-IP block for those hosts only.
- Address Book: mark/unmark a contact as a gas station in the editor (checkbox); previously only fuel-record quick-add could set it.
- Reverse proxy: `MYGARAGE_ROOT_PATH` serves MyGarage under a URL subpath (e.g. `/mygarage`) behind a prefix-stripping proxy — OIDC, PWA, media, and deep-links included; no image rebuild required (#107).
- Preferences: per-user 12-hour / 24-hour time format (Settings → System, default 12-hour), applied to every displayed time and the fuel fill-up time entry.
- i18n: Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation — thanks [@FabioCastilho](https://github.com/FabioCastilho).
- Vehicles: `fuel_type`/`fuel_type_secondary` are normalized and validated against the canonical vocabulary on create/update; a migration backfills legacy mixed-case/alias values in place.
- DEF: diesel-only gates on record create/update, tank capacity, fuel-sync, and CSV import — non-diesel vehicles get a 400 instead of accepting spurious DEF data; full-backup restore stays exempt so a user's own archive always restores completely; the DEF tab renders read-only (history visible, add/edit hidden) for non-diesel vehicles.
- LiveLink: a conservative param-class inference catalog classifies new telemetry parameters at registration and backfills existing rows via migration, activating range/rate-of-change validation for previously-unvalidated PIDs.
- LiveLink: threshold-breach alerts now honor the existing alert-cooldown admin setting instead of firing on every breaching frame.
- Notifications: DEF-low Discord alert — a daily check compares the latest DEF fill level against a configurable threshold (default 25%) with crossing-based dedup; threshold is configurable in Settings > Notifications.

### Changed
- Fuel tracking (fuel, DEF, propane) is now its own primary vehicle tab instead of a Maintenance sub-tab; `?tab=fuel/def/propane` deep-links still work (#116).
- Maintenance templates: `POST /api/maintenance-templates/apply` returns 410 Gone — application had been a silent no-op since the schedule system was removed; use Reminders instead.

### Fixed
- Translations: the PWA install prompt, Shop Finder, the notification setup forms, and the add-station dialog showed raw keys (`installPrompt.title`) instead of text — 32 strings were missing from every language.
- Translations: Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian are complete again — the fuel Rebate field, fill-up date/time, and the gas-station address-book fields were English-only.
- Fuel: editing a fill-up now shows the station it was saved with, and retyping one replaces it (#108).
- Fuel: editing a "one-time visit" station no longer adds it to the address book (#108).
- Export: the fuel CSV "Station" column now shows the station name for address-book stations (#108).
- Quick Entry: no longer shows "No vehicles" on a cold app launch when the account has them — the vehicle list is fetched fresh (no longer service-worker cached) and retries instead of dead-ending (#114).
- Fuel economy: partial fill-ups between two full tanks now count toward the next full tank's L/100km across every surface (record, average, garage card, widget, Analytics) instead of being ignored (#113).
- Mobile layout: the Home and Fuel History action buttons no longer overflow the viewport — both toolbars stack/wrap on narrow screens instead of forcing a single fixed-width row (#115).
- Analytics: the CSV and PDF export buttons are now a single "Export" dropdown, so the header no longer runs off narrow screens.
- Settings: the section tabs now use the same responsive layout as the vehicle sub-tabs (icons-only on mobile) instead of a single row that overflowed.
- PWA: serve `sw.js`, `manifest.json`, and the SPA shell with `Cache-Control: no-cache` so CDN edge caches (e.g. Cloudflare) can't pin a stale service worker or index across deploys.
- Address Book: State/region field accepts non-US codes (e.g. VIC, NSW) up to 50 chars — editor and fuel quick-add now agree (#108).
- Address Book: unify the gas-station tag on `gas_station` (FATAL migration 065) so the Gas-Stations filter, autocomplete ranking, and vendor-sync exclusion all match; quick-add-created stations are now correctly excluded from vendor sync (#108).
- Fuel: the fill-up time field follows the 12h/24h preference (12-hour has an explicit AM/PM selector) and drops the redundant separate date, replacing the locale-dependent native widget (#109).
- i18n: define 35 `common` keys referenced app-wide but missing from the English source, so form and table labels no longer render as raw keys (all five languages).
- Startup: ignore the `MYGARAGE_PORT=tcp://<ip>:<port>` service-link variable Kubernetes injects for a Service named `mygarage`; the app falls back to the default port instead of crashing on boot (#102).
- Vehicle delete: enable SQLite FK enforcement (`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`) and use an ORM delete so child rows cascade on both engines — deleting a vehicle no longer orphans its history (re-adding the same VIN silently resurrected it).
- Vehicle delete: remove the vehicle's photo/document directories and attachment rows+files from disk.
- Backup: full backups snapshot SQLite via the Online Backup API instead of copying the live WAL-mode files (torn-copy risk; db member now self-contained).
- Restore: stale `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars are removed so an old WAL can't replay over the restored database.
- Fuel economy: the vehicle-wide L/100km average no longer bridges across missed fill-ups (understated consumption); widget consumption gets the same guard.
- DEF analytics: consumption rate excludes the final unconsumed purchase (rate was overstated ~N/(N-1)).
- Users: admin user-delete pre-cleans share/transfer references so FK-enforcing engines accept it.
- Analytics: the vehicle Analytics page's DEF consumption card uses the same audited calculation as the DEF tab (a duplicate formula asserted a rate from insufficient data).
- Vehicles: clearing `fuel_type` on edit now actually clears the field instead of being silently dropped from the update payload.
- Vehicles: VIN-decode prefill uses the server-normalized fuel type instead of the raw NHTSA string.

### Removed
- Migration 060: drop the dead `tsbs` and `vincario_*` tables (`tsbs` still referenced a table dropped in migration 040 — an FK-mismatch landmine under enforcement).

## [2.30.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Widget API: new metric-native `/api/v2/widget/*` exposing both metric and imperial units per vehicle (superset of the legacy `/api/widget/*`).
- LiveLink: pull WiCAN SD-card telemetry into MyGarage to backfill offline gaps (auto on device reconnect + manual admin trigger).

### Fixed
- Auth: stop redirecting `auth_mode=none` users to the login page (#98).
- LiveLink: unify telemetry param_key casing across MQTT/HTTPS ingest (uppercase canonical), ending duplicate per-PID streams; migration merges existing rows.
- SQLite: enable WAL mode + 30s busy_timeout to stop "database is locked" errors under concurrent MQTT/scheduler/request writes.
- LiveLink: commit SD backfill inserts in batches (500) so a large pull doesn't hold the SQLite write lock for the entire operation.
- LiveLink: drop WiCAN frame-metadata params (`TS`, `TIMESTAMP`) at every ingest path — they aren't telemetry and flooded storage (existing rows purged).

### Security
- Bump `pydantic-settings` 2.14.1 → 2.14.2 (GHSA symlink-traversal in `NestedSecretsSettingsSource`; unused here, alert cleanup).
- LiveLink: sanitize `device_id` in SD-backfill task logs (CodeQL `py/log-injection`).

## [2.29.0] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- LiveLink: track-aware WiCAN firmware checks (OBD vs PRO).

### Added
- Docs: LiveLink setup guide covering primary + failover webhook configuration.

### Security
- Frontend: pin transitive deps via `overrides` to clear `bun audit` (brace-expansion, postcss, undici, form-data, js-yaml, @babel/core).

### Build
- Frontend: add `ESNext.Temporal` to tsconfig `lib` for the temporal-polyfill 1.0 global types.

## [2.28.0] - 2026-05-30

### Security
- Vehicle delete/transfer, identity-metadata edits, archive/unarchive/visibility, and window-sticker upload/edit/delete are now OWNER-only — a write-share can no longer perform them (D-2/D-3/D-8)
- Child-record writes (trailer, photos, maintenance-template apply/delete, DTC annotate/clear, spot-rental billing) now require a write-share, not just any share (D-4)
- Closed IDORs: transfer-history and spot-rental-billing gate vehicle access before querying
- LiveLink global infra (settings, ingestion token, MQTT, parameter defs, firmware, global device list) is admin-only; per-device ops require ownership of the device's linked vehicle, and relink checks both the current and target VIN (D-5)
- `GET /api/dashboard` and `GET /api/vehicles/archived/list` (plus archive/unarchive/visibility) switch `optional_auth` → `require_auth`, closing the local/oidc no-token fail-open
- CSV export fields are sanitized against spreadsheet formula injection (string-only; numeric cells preserved)
- File uploads reject content/declared-type magic-byte mismatches (400) instead of logging and storing; photos are decoded before the disk write; attachment/document configs are strict; window-sticker uploads gain MIME + magic-byte checks
- LiveLink ingest endpoint gains an in-app body-size cap (413) via pure-ASGI middleware
- POI TomTom API key sent as a request header (not a query param) so it can't leak via error-path logs
- MQTT subscriber sanitizes the decoded broker payload before debug logging

### Changed
- Security tripwire rewritten from greps to a stdlib-`ast` checker (`backend/tools/authz_tripwire.py`) inspecting call args, decorators, the service layer, and a one-level call graph
- Settings → Integrations: the LiveLink panel is shown only to admins (matches the admin-only infra endpoints)

### Fixed
- Service worker: route document-destination requests (browser/Cloudflare speculative prefetch of SPA routes like `/vehicles/{vin}`) through the navigation fallback, so a cancelled/transient prefetch no longer surfaces as an "Uncaught (in promise) Failed to fetch"

## [2.27.2] - 2026-05-27

### Security
- Bump FastAPI floor to >=0.136.3 to pull Starlette >=1.0.1 (CVE-2026-48710 BadHost header auth bypass)

### Fixed
- Restore `console.error` in ErrorBoundary so render failures surface in dev tools
- Add backdrop click-to-close on FormModalWrapper to prevent invisible overlay from blocking all clicks
- Add 5-second timeout on service worker navigation fetches to prevent indefinite hangs

## [2.27.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- `GET /api/auth/oidc/config/admin` returns the canonical admin OIDC config; `client_secret` is masked with the literal `"********"` placeholder when stored
- `PUT /api/auth/oidc/config/admin` writes the OIDC config atomically; empty `client_secret` preserves the stored value, trailing slashes on `issuer_url` are stripped
- `MYGARAGE_LOG_PRETTY=true` switches container logs to the Rich-formatted compact `[HH:MM:SS] LEVEL  message` layout used by TideWatch and VulnForge

### Changed
- `POST /api/auth/oidc/test` now returns the canonical `{ok, error, detail, issuer, algorithms_supported}` envelope per the homelab OIDC settings contract
- OIDC settings modal: Issuer URL helper text corrected (the app appends `/.well-known/openid-configuration` itself), Callback URL display has a copy button, test result renders the canonical envelope
- Settings save now sends OIDC fields to the dedicated admin endpoint so the `client_secret` cannot be inadvertently cleared via the bulk `/settings/batch` upsert
- Granian access-log healthcheck filter now matches on the exact request path and lets failures (HTTP >= 400) through, replacing the loose substring check that previously also swallowed `/health-status` and similar

### Security
- OIDC login flow now uses PKCE S256 (RFC 7636); `code_verifier` persisted on `oidc_states` and sent in the token exchange.
- ID token verifier explicitly allowlists `EdDSA` and `RS256` algorithms.

## [2.27.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Extended fuel tracking (#69): optional fuel-up time, fueling station with autocomplete and one-time-visit toggle, driver, payment method, trip type, outside temperature, and trip-computer (OBC) values on every fill-up.
- "Auto-fill from last drive" button on the fuel form pulls OBC values from the most recent matching LiveLink drive session.
- Per-user default payment method and trip type under Settings → System.
- "Gas Stations" filter on the Address Book page.
- Vehicles now track a secondary fuel type (PHEV / flex / dual-fuel), populated from NHTSA. Multi-fuel vehicles get a per-fillup fuel-type dropdown.
- Inline "+ Add to address book" action and an X clear button on the station autocomplete.
- Pagination on the fuel records list (50 per page, prev/next).
- Manual address search on the POI Finder, alongside "Use my location".
- VIN duplicate check fires on field blur during vehicle add.
- OBC trip duration field accepts `HH:MM` and `HH:MM:SS` in addition to seconds.
- Fuel records CSV export now includes every v2.27.0 column. Schema bumped 3 → 4 (additive).
- CSV fuel import reads the `Fuel Type` column with locale-aware normalization.

### Changed

- Fuel record save now runs as a single transaction across station resolution, odometer sync, and DEF sync — no more partial writes on failure.
- Gas-station address-book entries no longer create vendor records.
- Fuel records now require both an odometer reading and a fuel amount. `missed_fillup` is the explicit escape hatch for partial entries.
- `/assets/*` static files ship `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (Vite hashes the filenames).
- Photo and thumbnail endpoints ship `Cache-Control: private, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
- `AuthContext` dispatches `/settings/public` and `/auth/me` in parallel via `Promise.allSettled` instead of sequentially.
- LiveLink status polling (5s detail / 30s widget) pauses while the tab is hidden.
- README Bun badge now auto-updates from `.bun-version` instead of hardcoding the version.

### Fixed

- Migration 054 failed on PostgreSQL (#69): `DATETIME` and `ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS` are not valid PG syntax. Now dialect-aware.
- Polish/Ukrainian/Russian fuel types (e.g. `Benzyna`, `Дизель`, `Газ`) silently mapped to `other` instead of the right canonical value.
- Vehicle add/edit form rendered free-text for fuel type instead of a dropdown.
- Stations saved from POI search were not selectable in the fuel-record form (filter mismatch).
- Deleting a fuel record left an orphan synced entry on the mileage timeline. Migration 055 adds a proper FK with cascade and cleans up existing orphans.
- "Per volume" / "per weight" labels, the outside-temperature label (°C / °F), and the POI search radius now respect the user's unit preference. Imperial users type Fahrenheit; canonical Celsius storage is unchanged.
- Service worker no longer pins to a hardcoded cache name — caches are namespaced by `APP_VERSION` so stale shells are evicted on activate.
- Service worker asset fetches retry 3× with exponential backoff before surfacing the error, covering the backend cold-start window.
- Service worker no longer precaches `/` or `/index.html` (stale references to old chunk hashes after deploys).
- Service worker no longer caches photo/attachment/document/backup/realtime responses — `response.clone()` was stalling user fetches behind the CacheStorage write.
- Custom middleware (`SecurityHeaders`, `RequestID`, `CSRFProtection`) rewritten as pure ASGI so streaming responses no longer buffer through `BaseHTTPMiddleware`'s asyncio queue.
- Removed `SlowAPIMiddleware`; per-route `@limiter.limit(...)` decorators still enforce limits, and the global `default_limits` floor is already provided by Traefik's `common-rates` chain.
- PG integration tests now run in CI under the docker-compose.test.yml sidecar (#77 — wired via `pg-migrations-pytest-path` covering both `tests/migrations/` and `tests/integration/`).

### Dockerfile Dependencies

- **oven/bun**: 1.3.12-alpine → 1.3.14-alpine

## [2.26.4] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- DEF and propane records displayed canonical liters as gallons on imperial accounts, and the DEF edit form showed canonical $/L in the $/gal field. Same regression as the fuel fix in v2.26.3.
- Propane records were saved with `price_basis='per_tank'` while the form's UI and math were per-volume, so per-record price lookups were inconsistent with the rest of the app's metric-canonical storage. New saves now use `per_volume`; legacy records lazy-migrate on next edit.

## [2.26.3] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Fuel record price/gal displayed and saved as raw $/L on imperial accounts (regression from #67 in v2.26.2).
- Fresh installs failed at migrations 038 and 048: `Base.metadata.create_all` produces the post-#67 canonical schema (`odometer_km`, `due_mileage_km`), but those migrations tried to create indexes on the now-removed legacy columns (`mileage`, `due_mileage`). Added column-existence guards so a fresh install completes all 53 migrations on both PostgreSQL and SQLite. Existing installs are unaffected (already-applied migrations stay skipped via `schema_migrations`).

## [2.26.2] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Widget API keys and read-only `/api/widget/*` endpoints for gethomepage integration. Users can generate per-user keys from **Settings → Integrations → API Keys** and poll `summary`, `vehicles`, and `vehicle/{vin}` for tile data. Keys are SHA-256 hashed at rest, revocable, and scoped to either all of the user's vehicles or a selected subset (ownership is re-checked at every request). Requires `auth_mode=local` or `oidc`.
- Stale badge on API keys that haven't been used in 90+ days.

### Changed

- Login screen now shows the SSO button and a "Continue with password" toggle when OIDC is enabled, instead of rendering both options simultaneously.
- Integrations tab: "Homepage / Widget API Keys" renamed to "API Keys" with consumer-agnostic copy; panel redesigned to match the rest of Settings and spans the full row inside the integrations grid.

### Fixed

- Currency symbol now respects the user's currency preference across forms, lists, analytics charts, and PDF reports (#68).
- Storage flipped to SI-metric canonical (km, L, kg, L/100km). Metric users no longer lose precision on round-trips and fuel cost/volume/price math now agrees end to end (#67). Legacy widget API and v2 backups continue to work.
- About page rendered raw i18n keys (`about.tagline`, `about.whatIsTitle`, etc.) instead of translated strings — added the missing `about` block to `common.json` across all four locales (en/pl/ru/uk).
- Migration 053 (#67) refused to start on databases retaining frozen audit backup tables (`*_records_backup*`) left by older migrations. The preflight scan now skips backup-named tables since they're not part of the active schema and their imperial column references are intentional historical snapshots.
- Computed fuel economy (L/100 km) was serializing as null on `/api/vehicles/{vin}/fuel` responses — the route was setting the legacy `mpg` dict key while the response schema only declared `l_per_100km` (#67).
- Missing translations on Address Book, Find POI, and the login footer — pages previously rendered raw i18n keys (`addressBook.title`, `poiFinder.title`, `auth.tagline`).
- API-key timestamps showing "just now" on hours-old rows. Timestamps across widget keys, drive sessions, DTCs, photos, archived vehicles, transfers, backups, and telemetry charts now render at the correct wall-clock time regardless of the user's timezone.
- Insurance and warranty expiry filters and family-dashboard service dates were off-by-one day for users west of UTC.

## [2.25.1] - 2026-03-26

> **Warning -- Backup Recommended:** Back up your data directory before updating. This release includes changes to static file serving that affect translation loading.

### Fixed
- Fix settings i18n namespace mismatch and missing `/locales` static mount -- Settings.tsx used wrong i18n namespace ('common' instead of 'settings'), causing raw translation keys to render; backend also never mounted `/locales` as a static path, so non-English translation files were unreachable
- Remove deprecated `ignoreDeprecations` from tsconfig.json (TypeScript 6 compatibility cleanup)

- Fix Vite 8 build failure: convert `manualChunks` from object to function for Rolldown compatibility

### Removed
- Maintenance schedule system (tables, routes, services, frontend components)

- Migrate 14 form components from raw `api.post`/`api.put` to TanStack Query mutation hooks for automatic cache invalidation
- Adopt `FormModalWrapper` in 5 more form components (NoteForm, RecallForm, TollTagForm, TollTransactionForm, ServiceVisitForm)
- Expand `FormModalWrapper` with icon, footer, isOpen, and zIndex props; adopt in OIDCModal and LocalAuthModal
- Migrate document upload to TanStack Query mutation hook for automatic cache invalidation
- Consolidate `formatDateForInput` from 9 local copies to shared `dateUtils.ts` import

- Quick Entry page — vehicle selector (auto-selects if only one), three large action buttons (Fuel Up, Service, Mileage), success toast on submit, Dashboard escape link
- Calendar now shows maintenance schedule items with status badges (overdue, due soon, never done) and miles-remaining indicators in the sidebar
- Never-performed maintenance items with no intervals now appear on today's date as "needs attention" items in the calendar
- Background scheduler for automated notifications — maintenance due/overdue, insurance/warranty expiration, NHTSA recall checks (weekly), and odometer milestone alerts (every 10k miles); enable with `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true` environment variable
- Configurable notification thresholds: `notify_service_days` (default 30) and `notify_service_miles` (default 500) in Settings → Notifications
- Odometer milestone notifications — opt-in via Settings → Notifications → Milestones; triggers at every 10,000-mile boundary

### Fixed

- Service visit create/update/delete now enforce write permission on shared vehicles (403 for read-only shares)
- Odometer read/write endpoints now enforce vehicle ownership and share permissions for all five operations

### Changed

### Fixed
- Replaced deprecated `React.FormEvent` with `SyntheticEvent<HTMLFormElement>` across 9 components (React 19 type cleanup)

## [2.22.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- LiveLink session grace period — configurable delay (0-300s, default 60) before ending sessions after WiFi drops, preventing phantom micro-sessions
- LiveLink MQTT command publishing — send `get_vbatt`, `get_autopid_data`, and `reboot` to WiCAN devices via MQTT
- LiveLink telemetry validation — range and rate-of-change checks reject garbage values from partial ECU wakes
- LiveLink grouped PID format support — forward-compatible parsing for community firmware forks

### Fixed
- Database startup crash on retry — migrations 002, 006, 022, 026, 030 now clean up stale temp tables before recreating them, preventing "table already exists" errors after a failed upgrade
- Vehicle sharing modal crash — backend response unwrapping fixed in familyService
- LiveLink token-bound device resolution — global token with multiple devices no longer attaches telemetry to wrong vehicle
- LiveLink DTC ingestion — `DIAGNOSTIC_TROUBLE_CODES` string values now survive schema validation
- LiveLink MQTT unknown status — malformed status messages no longer trigger false session transitions

### Tests
- Added migration test harness — 9 tests covering runner behavior (tracking table, discovery order, stop-on-failure, noop second run) and crash-recovery regression for migrations 002, 006, 022, 026, 030 (closes #35)

### Changed
- Simplified top nav from 7 items to 5 — VIN Decoder moved to About page modal, Family merged into Settings

### Changed
- Streamlined About page — removed duplicated features, tech stack, and statistics (now lives on project website); added links to website and GitHub

### Fixed
- Fuel service write permission checks (added `require_write=True` to create/update/delete)
- Garage PDF export now uses `model_dump()` — fixes missing `total_upgrades`, `total_inspection`, `total_collision`, `total_detailing`, `total_def` fields

- **DEF in Vehicle Analytics** - Dedicated section with spend, gallons, avg cost/gal, consumption rate
- **Inline Analytics Cards** - Added to Fuel and Propane tabs to match DEF tab pattern
- **Migration 039** - Backfills `service_visits.total_cost` from line items + tax/fees for existing records
- **`visits_to_dataframe()`** - New analytics service function producing one DataFrame row per visit (visit-level totals for financial accuracy)
- **Write-path total_cost sync** - `total_cost` is always recomputed from `calculated_total_cost` on every service visit create, update, line item add, and line item delete
- **Test Suite Expansion** - Added 120 new tests (85 backend + 35 frontend), up from 1,011 to 1,131 total
  - Backend: CSRF middleware (20), LiveLink token validation (10), notification dispatcher (30), analytics service (25)
  - Frontend: ErrorBoundary (6), ThemeContext (8), AuthContext (9), VehicleDetail page (12)
- **Playwright E2E Tests** - 13 end-to-end tests across 5 specs (auth, dashboard, navigation, settings, vehicle) with full frontend-to-backend coverage
  - Dual web server setup (Granian backend + Vite frontend) with fresh SQLite per run
  - API-based auth setup with CSRF token handling
  - CI pipeline integration with Playwright report and test result artifacts

### Changed
- **Analytics migrated to ServiceVisit** - All analytics, dashboard, reports, calendar, and family dashboard now query `service_visits` + `service_line_items` instead of legacy `service_records` table
- **Report CSV columns** - Service history CSV headers changed: "Service Type" → "Category", "Vendor Name" → "Vendor", added "Notes"
- **Schema rename** - `GarageMonthlyTrend.maintenance` → `GarageMonthlyTrend.service` in analytics API and frontend
- **CSV/JSON export** - Service export now queries `ServiceVisit` with line items and vendor relationships; JSON keeps `"service_records"` key for backward-compatible re-import
- **CSV/JSON import** - Service CSV/JSON import now creates `ServiceVisit` + `ServiceLineItem` + `Vendor`; accepts both old ("Service Type") and new ("Category") CSV headers
- **Attachments route** - `get_attachment_vin()` handles both `record_type='service'` and `'service_visit'` via ServiceVisit lookup
- **TypeScript target** - ES2020 → ES2022
- Removed misleading DEF Level gauge from analytics cards (fill level stays in table)
- **Dependency Updates** - Updated 18 Python dependency floors (fastapi, sqlalchemy, aiosqlite, pydantic, httpx, pandas 3.0, pillow, pillow-heif, reportlab, pymupdf, aiomqtt, authlib security patch, and more)
- **aiosmtplib 3.x to 5.x** - Pin-only update, API fully backwards compatible
- **pydantic-settings 2.6 to 2.12** - Replaced deprecated `class Config` with `model_config = SettingsConfigDict()`
- **Dockerfile Alignment** - Aligned pip (26.0.1) and bun (1.3.8) labels with actual versions
- **Ruff target-version** - Changed from `py314` to `py313` to avoid PEP 758 syntax issues, fixed 22 except clauses across 18 files

### Fixed
- **Family Dashboard vehicle images not displaying** - Construct proper API URLs for vehicle photos instead of passing raw DB paths
- **Analytics 500 error for vehicles with 3+ months of cost data** - Convert Decimal values to float before numpy trend calculation
- **Maintenance templates create schedule items instead of reminders** - Apply Template now creates `MaintenanceScheduleItem` records with duplicate detection, not deprecated `Reminder` objects
- **MissingGreenlet on service visit creation** - `calculated_total_cost` property triggered lazy load of `line_items` in async context; now eagerly refreshes relationship first
- **LiveLink session duration datetime bug** - Normalized naive `session_started_at` to UTC before arithmetic in `livelink_vehicle.py`
- **ESLint `preserve-caught-error`** - Added `{ cause }` to re-thrown errors in AuthContext
- **LiveLink Odometer Unit Conversion** - Standard OBD2 PID A6 (Odometer) reports in kilometers per SAE J1979, but values were stored directly as miles. Now converts km to miles based on the system `distance_unit` setting. Custom PIDs (e.g. Mitsubishi-specific) are left as-is since they already report in the configured unit.
- **Fuel/Service Odometer Sync Blocked by LiveLink** - Adding a fuel fill-up or service record on the same date as a LiveLink odometer reading failed to create/update the odometer record. The sync logic only checked notes for `[AUTO-SYNC from` markers but didn't recognize LiveLink-sourced records as overwritable. Now checks the `source` field and allows fuel/service data to take priority over LiveLink telemetry.
- **Odometer Record Source Field** - Auto-synced odometer records from fuel and service entries were created with `source="manual"` instead of the correct `source="fuel"` or `source="service"`. New and updated records now set the source field properly.
- **Naive/Aware Datetime Mismatch** - Fixed `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` in drive session duration calculation and device offline notification. SQLite strips timezone info on storage; reads are now normalized to UTC before arithmetic.
- **VehicleDetail Offline Cache** - Offline cache path incorrectly set error state, making the cached data warning banner unreachable; now correctly shows cached vehicle data with offline warning instead of error page
- **VehicleDetail JSON.parse Safety** - Wrapped localStorage cache parsing in try-catch; corrupted cache is cleared on failure instead of crashing
- **Theme Context Race Condition** - Added `cancelled` flag with cleanup in useEffect to prevent stale state updates on unmount
- **Dashboard Error State** - Replaced silent catch with user-visible error UI and retry button
- **Auth Timeout** - Replaced unreliable 100ms `setTimeout` in AuthContext with immediate try + 50ms retry pattern

### Improved
- **N+1 Query Fix** - `check_device_offline_status()` pre-fetches all vehicle names in a single query instead of N separate queries per device
- **Thread Pool Offloading** - File writes, thumbnail creation, and Tesseract OCR calls now run in `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the event loop
- **CSRF Middleware** - Refactored to use `async with get_db_context()` context manager, eliminating potential resource leaks from manual `anext()`/`aclose()`
- **Query Deduplication** - Extracted shared ownership filter in `VehicleService.list_vehicles()`
- **Exception Handling** - Specific `(ValueError, TypeError)` for bcrypt in auth service, token expiry log downgraded to debug level, `.is_(True)` idiom for SQLAlchemy boolean comparisons
- **Currency Formatting** - Consolidated all 12 duplicate `formatCurrency` implementations into shared `formatUtils.ts` utility
- **Modal State** - VehicleDetail modal management simplified from 4 boolean `useState` hooks to single `ModalType` union type
- **Auth Page Layout** - Extracted shared `AuthPageLayout` component, removing ~80 lines of duplication from Login and Register pages
- **Dead Code Removal** - Removed unused `toll-tags-refresh` window event listener and unused `onRefresh` prop from TollTagList
- **Accessibility** - Added ARIA labels to icon-only nav links, `role="status"` to loading spinners, progressbar attributes to password strength meter, `aria-label` to filter/sort dropdowns
- **Pyright Strict Mode** - Reduced `"none"` suppressions from 13 to 7 (46% reduction), warnings from 1,317 to 1,296; fixed insurance parser method signatures, constant redefinition patterns, and untyped parameters

### Removed
- **Legacy ServiceRecord** - Deleted model, routes (`/api/vehicles/{vin}/service`), service layer, schemas, and tests. All functionality replaced by ServiceVisit + ServiceLineItem
- **Legacy frontend components** - Removed `ServiceRecordForm`, `ServiceRecordList`, `types/service.ts`, `schemas/service.ts` (dead code since ServiceVisit migration)
- **Legacy attachment endpoints** - Removed `/api/service/{id}/attachments` upload/list endpoints (replaced by `/api/service-visits/{id}/attachments`)
- **Migration 040** - Drops `service_records` table and migrates any remaining `record_type='service'` attachments to `'service_visit'`

### Fixed
- **LiveLink Drive Sessions Not Recording** - Fixed three bugs preventing session creation
  - Background scheduler (APScheduler) was never started — session timeouts and device offline detection never ran
  - `set_device_offline` only reset `device_status` but not `ecu_status`, leaving it permanently stuck at "online"
  - Status update was applied before session transition detection in all three ingestion paths (HTTPS, MQTT status, MQTT telemetry), causing the transition detector to see stale state
- **LiveLink Session Aggregates Missing** - Fixed speed, RPM, coolant temp, throttle, and fuel stats showing "--" on completed sessions
  - Aggregate calculation looked for generic param keys (`SPEED`, `ENGINE_RPM`) but WiCAN sends OBD2 PID-prefixed keys (`0D-VehicleSpeed`, `0C-EngineRPM`)
  - Now matches both naming conventions via case-insensitive multi-key lookup
- **NHTSA Recall Check Error Handling** - Fixed unhandled ValueError when VIN cannot be decoded by NHTSA

  - Extended existing odometer sanity checks to filter values before storing in latest cache
  - Invalid values (overflow, >1M miles, >10K jump) are now rejected from Live display
  - Prevents OBD2 parsing errors (like 24-bit overflow 0xFFFFFF) from showing incorrect readings
- **LiveLink Odometer Double Conversion** - Fixed incorrect odometer display in LiveLink showing ~62% of actual value
  - WiCAN devices report odometer in vehicle's native unit (miles for US vehicles)
  - Frontend was incorrectly applying km→miles conversion to values already in miles
  - Odometer now displays raw OBD2 value without conversion on Live tab and Sessions tab
- **Document Deletion Error Handling** - Improved document deletion with proper transaction rollback
  - File system errors now properly abort the database transaction
  - Added explicit error handling for database and OS errors
  - Consistent with attachment deletion behavior
- **LiveLink Charts Missing Parameters** - Charts tab now shows all available telemetry parameters
  - Previously only showed parameters with `show_on_dashboard` flag (just Battery Voltage)

  - Updated UserManagementModal, AddEditUserModal, and SettingsSystemTab to import from shared type
- **Authentication Mode UI** - Redesigned Settings > System authentication configuration
  - Renamed "Local JWT" button to "Local" for clarity
  - Local and OIDC configuration now open in modal dialogs instead of inline forms

  - **CSV Export**: Updated to include all service category columns (still uses full vehicle name for data export)
  - Backend now groups service records by `service_category` field for accurate analytics

- **Vehicle Detail Page - Non-Motorized Vehicle Handling**
  - **Powertrain Section Hidden**: Trailers, Fifth Wheels, and Travel Trailers no longer show the "Powertrain" section (they don't have engines)
  - **Fuel Type in Vehicle Details**: For non-motorized vehicles with propane (fifth wheels, travel trailers), fuel type now displays in the "Vehicle Details" card instead of Powertrain
  - Uses existing `isMotorized` check to conditionally render appropriate sections

### Fixed

## [2.18.1] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **Type Safety & Static Analysis - Complete Backend Type Coverage**
  - **Phase 1:** Fixed 40+ Pyright type errors across backend infrastructure (database, middleware, models, routes)
    - AsyncGenerator type annotation for `get_db()` dependency function
    - Date field shadowing in 6 SQLAlchemy models (fuel, note, odometer, service, tax, toll)
    - Boolean return types in authentication models (CSRF, OIDC)
    - FastAPI exception handler type annotations
    - Route dependency injection parameter ordering
  - **Phase 2:** Fixed 100 Pyright type errors across services and utilities (27 files)
    - Third-party library imports: Added suppressions for pandas, numpy, OCR libraries (fitz, pytesseract, paddleocr), pdfplumber, reportlab, magic
    - SQLAlchemy ORM issues: File-level suppressions for Column type descriptor patterns (oidc, auth, vehicle_service)
    - Optional type handling: Framework guarantees (FastAPI) ensure values exist at runtime
    - Return type mismatches: Business logic guarantees types that Pyright cannot infer
    - Method override compatibility: Intentional design pattern for extensibility
  - **Phase 3:** Reduced Pyright warnings from 832 to 723 (13% reduction, 109 warnings fixed)
    - Fixed code quality issues: unused variables, unused imports, deprecated Pydantic v1 APIs
    - Migrated `@validator` to `@field_validator` (Pydantic v2 compatibility)
    - Added proper type annotations: ValidationInfo, parameter types, return types
    - Made `cache.generate_key()` public API (was protected `_generate_key`)
    - Suppressed SlowAPI rate limiter decorator warnings (library without type stubs)
  - **Result:** 140+ total errors fixed, 100% type safety achieved across entire backend (0 Pyright errors, 723 warnings)

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Service Records Schema Redesign**
  - Separated service category from specific service type for better analytics and predictions
  - **Database Changes:**
    - `service_type` field renamed to `service_category` (Maintenance, Inspection, Collision, Upgrades)
    - `description` field renamed to `service_type` with 50+ predefined options (Oil Change, Tire Rotation, etc.)
    - All existing records migrated with `service_type = 'General Service'` (users update manually)
    - Backup table created: `service_records_backup_20251229`
  - **Analytics Impact:**
    - Predictions now group by specific service type instead of generic category
    - Example: "Next Oil Change due in 90 days" vs "Next Maintenance due in 45 days"
    - Higher confidence scores due to consistent service-specific intervals
  - **UI Changes:**
    - Service Record Form: Added cascading dropdowns (Category filters Service Type options)
    - Service Record List: Column headers updated (Category | Service Type | Mileage | Cost)
    - Search filters now search both category and service type fields
  - **Migration:** Database migration 022 runs automatically on backend startup
  - **User Action Required:** Update existing service records via UI to change 'General Service' to specific types
  - **Files Updated:** 17 total (10 backend, 4 frontend, 3 tests including exports, reports, calendar integration)
  - **Tests Updated:** pytest fixtures and payloads updated to match new schema (vin/mileage/service_type fields)

### Fixed
- **Analytics Data Quality & Calculation Accuracy**
  - Invalid MPG filtering: Filter out 0/negative miles driven and unrealistic MPG values (<5 or >100)
    - Prevents worst MPG showing 0.0 due to data entry errors or odometer corrections
    - Two-stage filtering: before calculation (invalid trips) and after (unrealistic MPG)
    - Handles edge cases: zero miles between fill-ups, negative mileage, extreme outliers
  - Weighted average MPG calculation: Changed from simple mean to total_miles/total_gallons
    - More accurate representation of overall fuel efficiency
    - Accounts for varying trip lengths (long highway vs short city trips)
    - Example: 450mi/15gal + 50mi/10gal = 20 MPG weighted vs 17.5 MPG simple mean
  - Recent MPG label clarity: Changed from 5-record rolling average to single most recent fill-up
    - Backend: `df["mpg"].iloc[-1]` instead of `df["mpg"].tail(5).mean()`
    - Frontend: Label updated from "Recent" to "Latest Fill-Up" for clarity

- **Analytics UI/UX Improvements**
  - Card spacing consistency: Standardized Summary Stats grid spacing from `gap-4` to `gap-6`
    - Matches spacing standard across all analytics sections
    - Spacing hierarchy: major sections (`gap-8`), card grids (`gap-6`), compact rows (`gap-4`)
  - Spot rental filtering: Only display for RV-type vehicles (FifthWheel, RV, TravelTrailer)
    - Backend: Check vehicle_type before querying spot rental data
    - Frontend: Conditionally render bar chart based on `hasPropane` flag
    - Removes empty spot rental bars from car/truck analytics

- **Maintenance Prediction Clarity**
  - Enhanced prediction display to show both AI predictions AND manual reminders
  - Schema additions: `has_manual_reminder`, `manual_reminder_date`, `manual_reminder_mileage` fields
  - Backend integration: Query active reminders and fuzzy-match to service types
  - Frontend enhancements:
    - Service type displayed in larger, prominent font
    - "REMINDER SET" purple badge when manual reminder exists
    - "AI predicts:" label in blue for AI-generated predictions from service history
    - "You set:" label in purple for manual user reminders
    - Both systems displayed simultaneously with distinct styling
  - Helps users understand difference between automated predictions and their own reminders
  - All changes backward compatible (optional fields with defaults)

  - All helper functions accept `Optional[User]` for type safety with null checks
  - `get_vehicle_or_403()` and `check_vehicle_ownership()` handle None users (grant full access)
  - Vehicle/Service/Fuel service layers accept `Optional[User]`, show all data when user is None
  - Settings endpoints split: `/api/settings/public` (no auth) vs `/api/settings` (admin only)
  - All 100+ endpoints now work seamlessly with `auth_mode='none'`

### Fixed
- **Code Quality Improvements (Phase 3 - 71% reduction in linting issues)**
  - Fixed F821 (undefined name): Added missing `Document` import in [vehicle.py:187](backend/app/models/vehicle.py#L187)
  - Fixed E722 (bare except): Replaced with specific `ValueError` in [insurance.py:129](backend/app/services/document_parsers/insurance.py#L129)

  - Eliminated ERROR logs ("No credentials provided") on page load before authentication
  - CSRF endpoint now uses `optional_auth` dependency, returns `{"csrf_token": None}` when disabled
  - Frontend no longer makes duplicate API calls to check auth_mode (centralized in AuthContext)
  - Resolved infinite loop issue (3 components independently calling `/settings/public` → 200+ requests)
- **Frontend Validation Error Serialization**
  - Fixed `TypeError: Object of type ValueError is not JSON serializable` in error handlers
  - Validation errors now properly converted to JSON-serializable format before response
- **Auth Mode 'None' Backend Validation**

  - Fixed AttributeError crashes from None user references in authorization helpers
  - Fixed 500 errors when accessing endpoints with `auth_mode='none'` enabled
  - Settings page now accessible without authentication when auth is disabled

### Security
- **CRITICAL: Authentication & Authorization Hardening (Phase 1)**
  - All vehicle data endpoints now require authentication via `require_auth` dependency
  - Implemented per-vehicle authorization - users can only access their own vehicles
  - Added `user_id` column to vehicles table with foreign key to users (database migration 013)
  - Admin users retain access to all vehicles for support purposes
  - Production safeguard: `auth_mode='none'` blocked in production without explicit `MYGARAGE_ALLOW_AUTH_NONE=true` flag
  - Startup warning displayed when `auth_mode='none'` is active
  - Authentication dependencies: `require_auth()` (smart enforcement) vs `optional_auth()` (never enforces)
  - Authorization helpers: `get_vehicle_or_403()`, `check_vehicle_ownership()` with None user support
  - 24+ endpoints hardened: vehicles, service records, fuel records, photos, settings
  - Public settings endpoint (`/api/settings/public`) works without authentication for frontend initialization
  - Prevents unauthenticated data access and cross-user data leakage in production
  - Allows development without authentication when explicitly configured
- **Dependency Security Validation (Phase 3)**
  - Zero vulnerabilities found in 79 scanned packages (Safety v3.7.0)
  - All dependencies up-to-date with no known CVEs
  - Key packages verified: fastapi 0.123.0, sqlalchemy 2.0.29, pillow 12.0.0, argon2-cffi 25.1.0
- **Code Security Validation (Phase 3)**
  - Bandit scan: Only 2 findings, both acceptable design choices
    - 0.0.0.0 binding (required for Docker container networking)
    - MD5 for cache keys (non-cryptographic use case with `usedforsecurity=False`)
  - No actual security vulnerabilities detected in 41,554 lines of code
  - Strong security posture validated by automated scanning

### Performance
- **Service Layer Optimizations**
  - MPG calculation now cached with 5-minute TTL (automatic invalidation on data changes)
  - Photo hydration removed from request hot path (one-time migration instead)
  - N+1 query optimizations in ServiceRecordService (pre-fetches attachment counts via JOIN)
  - Reduced code size improves application load time and memory footprint
- **Authentication Flow Optimization**
  - Single API call to check `auth_mode` instead of 3 duplicate calls
  - Resolved rate limit issues (200+ requests to `/settings/public` → 1 request)
  - Centralized state management prevents redundant network requests

### Technical Notes
- **Service Layer Architecture**: Implements dependency injection, integrated authorization, complete business logic separation from HTTP layer
- **Type Safety**: All functions use `Optional[User]` to force explicit null handling throughout codebase
- **Smart Authentication**: Functions check `auth_mode` setting dynamically - no hardcoded auth bypass logic
- **Graceful Degradation**: None users represent guest access with full permissions when auth is disabled
- **Code Quality**: 71% reduction in linting issues, 69% reduction in main route file, production-ready code
- **Backward Compatibility**: All API contracts maintained, photo endpoints work identically after extraction
- Database migrations: 013 (user_id for multi-user support), 014 (legacy photo hydration)
