 *     `bg-cover`.
 * A new, unrecognized color family is NOT grounds for exclusion — it falls through
 * to the defined-token check like everything else. Getting NON_COLOR_VALUES
 * slightly wrong produces a false positive (test fails, a human adds a keyword) —
 * a safe, self-correcting failure. The previous design used a positive whitelist of

 *
 * Deliberately not scoped to `className`/`class` JSX attributes only (the AST
 * would trivially support that narrower scope). Two real patterns in this
 * codebase put color-utility strings outside any JSX attribute entirely:
 *   - `CurrencyInputPrefix.tsx` / `TimeInput24.tsx` hoist a `DEFAULT_CLASS`
 *     constant and reference it (`className={className ?? DEFAULT_CLASS}`); the
 *     literal itself lives in a plain `const` initializer.
 *   - `schemas/auth.ts` returns `{ color: 'text-red-500' | ... }` from a plain
 *     function, consumed via `` className={`text-xs font-medium ${passwordStrength.color}`} ``
 *     in `Register.tsx` — a cross-file, non-JSX flow a `className`-attribute-only
 *     scope can't see without full data-flow analysis.
 * Scoping strictly to `className` attributes would silently stop scanning both,
 * trading the comment blind spot for an equally silent new one. Scanning every
 * literal instead has no such gap: no color-utility string, wherever it's
 * declared, can go unseen. Comments and JSX text (`JsxText` nodes, never string
 * literals) are excluded structurally either way. The remaining risk — a plain
 * string that happens to read like `prefix-word` but isn't a class reference

 *
 * That distinction is the whole fix. This codebase's dominant conditional-
 * class idiom is a ternary inside a template substitution —
 * `` `ui-motion ${isActive ? 'transition-transform' : ''}` `` (10+ call
 * sites, e.g. Calendar.tsx, WarrantyForm.tsx, LiveLinkSettingsModal.tsx) —
 * and a ternary's two branches are their own independent StringLiteral AST
 * nodes, siblings of the TemplateHead/TemplateTail, not merged with them by
 * the parser. collectLiteralTexts's flat, per-literal output reports that
 * expression as four unrelated strings ("ui-motion ", "transition-transform",
 * "", ""), and no single one of them contains both a `ui-motion*` token and a
 * native motion utility — a same-element co-occurrence check run against
 * each literal independently can never see the collision it exists to catch.
 *
 * The grouping boundary is the outermost TemplateExpression a literal is
 * nested in — NOT the enclosing JSX `className` attribute. That distinction
 * matters: a ConditionalExpression can also sit directly at the attribute
 * level (`className={cond ? \`ui-motion ...\` : \`ui-motion ...\`}`), picking
 * ONE whole template at runtime, never both — grouping at the attribute
 * level would concatenate two branches that can never co-occur and
 * manufacture a false collision. Grouping at the TemplateExpression itself is
 * still correct for the real idiom above, because a template's head/tail
 * text is unconditionally emitted every time that template is chosen, so
 * anything its own substitution contributes (however conditional) genuinely
 * does co-occur with it whenever that branch is taken. Un-scoped from
 * `className` attributes specifically for the same reason collectLiteralTexts
 * is (see its doc comment): a class string can be built in a hoisted constant
 * before ever reaching a `className=` attribute.
 *
 * A template whose ENTIRE content is one conditional substitution with no
 * unconditional literal glue (e.g. `` `${cond ? 'ui-motion' : 'transition-x'}` ``)
 * can, in theory, reproduce the attribute-level false-collision case above —
 * this boundary doesn't distinguish "has unconditional glue" from "is 100%
 * conditional." That's the same fail-safe trade this file makes everywhere
 * else (see COLOR_PREFIXES's design-principle comment near the top of this

   * internal emission order, not by design intent — structurally the same
   * bug class the rest of this file exists to eliminate, just for
   * `transition` instead of `border-color`.
   *
   * src/components/ui doesn't exist yet — Task 2 predates the primitives
   * Task 4 builds there — so this scan passes vacuously when the directory
   * is absent. That's an explicit, intentional existence check, not an
   * accident of a crashing glob: the moment the directory appears, this
   * test has real teeth.
   *
   * Scans via collectClassNameGroups, not collectLiteralTexts — a first
   * version of this tripwire tested each string-literal-shaped text span
   * independently and had a demonstrated false negative: this codebase's
   * dominant conditional-class idiom, a ternary inside a template
   * substitution (`` `ui-motion ${isActive ? 'transition-transform' : ''}` ``,
   * 10+ call sites), parses to four separate literal nodes and no single one
   * of them contains both tokens, so the per-literal check reported zero
   * offenders on exactly the input it exists to catch. See
   * collectClassNameGroups's doc comment for why the grouping boundary is
   * the TemplateExpression, not the enclosing `className` attribute.
   *
   * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH — read this before trusting a green run here.
   * This is literal-shaped-text-span analysis: it can only see tokens whose
   * text is physically present, in one piece, inside the AST node(s) it
   * walks. It has no data-flow analysis, so it cannot follow a string value
   * through a variable binding, an array join, or a call into another
   * module. Three concrete shapes are provably invisible to it — each has
   * been hand-traced against this exact scanner, they are not hypothetical:
   *
   *   1. A literal hoisted into a variable and interpolated by reference:
   *      `const base = 'ui-motion'` followed by
   *      `` className={`${base} ${cond ? 'transition-transform' : ''}`} ``.
   *      `base` is an Identifier, not a literal-text node — collectClassNameGroups
   *      groups by TemplateExpression and has no notion of resolving an
   *      Identifier substitution back to the string it was assigned, so
   *      'ui-motion' (which lives in the variable declarator's initializer,
   *      a separate AST node) is never joined with the template's group.
   *      This is not a hypothetical shape: see collectLiteralTexts' doc
   *      comment above for two REAL instances of the same hoisted-constant
   *      and cross-file flows already in this codebase
   *      (CurrencyInputPrefix.tsx / TimeInput24.tsx, and schemas/auth.ts
   *      into Register.tsx). Those are why that scanner is deliberately not
   *      scoped to className attributes — the same blind spot, already
   *      documented there with named examples rather than invented ones.
   *
   *   2. Class names assembled by array + join:
   *      `className={[baseClass, isActive && 'transition-transform'].join(' ')}`.
   *      The two class-bearing values are separate array elements, never
   *      merged into one TemplateExpression or one string literal — there
   *      is no single AST node whose joined text this scanner (or any
   *      per-node text-span scan) could ever produce.
   *
   *   3. A className-building helper defined outside src/components/ui/.
   *      This scan is directory-scoped (`walk(UI_DIR)`, by design — see the
   *      vacuous-pass note above) and never parses files elsewhere, so a
   *      shared helper such as `buildMotionClass()` living in, say,
   *      src/lib/ is never even read, whatever string it returns.
   *
   * None of these are bugs to fix at this layer. Static literal analysis
   * cannot perform data-flow analysis — following a value through a
   * binding, a join, or a cross-module call is a fundamentally heavier
   * class of tool, and building one here would only relocate this same
   * list one level down (a reassigned Identifier, a mutated array, a
   * helper that itself calls another helper). This tripwire is a
   * best-effort authoring aid, not a guarantee: it catches the idiom this
   * codebase actually uses in practice (the inline ternary-in-template
   * case, 10+ call sites) and nothing with more indirection than that. Real
   * coverage for the general case comes from two other places, not from
   * static analysis — the WARNING comment directly above `@utility
   * ui-motion` in src/index.css (the authoring rule itself: read it before
   * writing a primitive), and the browser verification of primitives in
   * the component gallery, where an actual cascade collision is visible as
   * a real, observable rendering bug, not a pattern match.
